# MobiDataLab Reference Data Catalogue demonstrators

MobiDataLab made available two metadata catalogues, CKAN and a GeoNetwork, which gathered more than 115k datasets from multiple data portals.

These datasets cover transport and mobility categories as well as other categories to enrich the mobility datasets in the context of the local challenges of the project stakeholders. Data was made discoverable, findable and accessible through these catalogues not only by providing the data sources of the datasets harvested but also by providing information about the different organizations offering open, premium and privileged data. 
Both catalogues offer human-readable and machine-readable metadata by being accessible via an API and a platform. Both are interoperable and allow the reuse of datasets by mobility digital services like journey planners.

The CKAN catalogue complies with mobility data sharing standards such as DCAT(JSON/RDF), DCAT-AP, CSW, CSW INSPIRE and CKAN API. For more information consult [ckannext-dcat](https://github.com/MobiDataLab/ckanext-dcat), 
[ckannex-spatial](https://github.com/MobiDataLab/ckanext-spatial), and [ckan-ext-inspire](https://github.com/MobiDataLab/ckan-ext-inspire). The metadata was translated during the harvesting stage. For more information consult
[ckanext-harvest](https://github.com/MobiDataLab/ckanext-harvest).

The GeoNetwork catalogue, a GIS-specific solution, allows consistent and standardized data representation. It supports the following harvesting protocols: OGC CSW 2.0.2 and WFS, GeoNetwork, Geoportal, and ArcSDE.

Two demonstration videos are available on this repository [Reference Data Catalogue demo v1](https://github.com/MobiDataLab/reference-data-catalogue-demo/blob/main/mdl-reference_data_catalogue_demo_v1-ckan.avi) and [Reference Data Catalogue demo v2](https://github.com/MobiDataLab/reference-data-catalogue-demo/blob/main/Reference_Data_Catalogue_demo_v2.mov) to learn more about how to discover, manage, visualize meta(data) on these catalogues.
A [pdf](https://github.com/MobiDataLab/reference-data-catalogue-demo/blob/main/mdl_reference_data_catalogue_demo_v2_ckan.pdf) of the demonstration presentation v2 is also available. The Reference Data Catalogue inventory will be very soon available as well.
